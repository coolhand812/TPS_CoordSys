# TPS_CoordSys - IS2320

This IS-2320 project is created to track students' accounts/receivable history

## Proposal

The team is proposing the development of an accounting-centric software dedicated to help the program coordinator track data currently tracked on multiple MS Excel sheets.
The ofice manages 4 different learning programs from approximately 9 different faculties at different campuses. This sistem will allow the program coordintator add students, track student monthly payements, show the amount paid to date, and the number of semesters remaining.
This data will be easily stored and easily viewed by the coordinator and his/her assistant. This system will also help generate reports to show the money received by each faculty by month and by year.
The system contains a database in MySQL format and will be coded in HTML, PHP, & CSS. This information system will have 2 levels of access with the program coordinator as a superuser and his/her assistant as a regular user.
